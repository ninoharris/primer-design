You are given by a lab colleague an expression vector which she says has an origin of replication and codes for glutathione-S-transferase followed by an in-frame thrombin cleavage site. She also tells you that the vector has a lac promoter 5’ to the gene for glutathione–S-transferase, codes elsewhere for LacI and has a multiple cloning site of the following sequence, where the 5’ ccc is in- frame with the glutathione-S-transferase reading frame (fig1)",
